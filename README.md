# Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analysis Pyber ride sharing data in order to better understand ride data and fare rates by which Pyber operates within. We were able to improve access to to ride-sharing and better quantify rates.
### Results
It was determined that densely populated urban areas have the highest demand for ride-sharing. Rural areas were nearly 4-5 times lower than urban areas for ride-sharing fares. Suburban areas were nearly the median between urban and rural areas.
#### Summary
If Pyber was to increase the amount of drivers in rural areas, there would be plenty of room for future growth. The data suggests that rural cities have a higher average fare ride because they have to travel across longer distances.
